# Soccer Schedule ICS Generator

A Python script that automatically fetches soccer schedules from the Lower Island Soccer Association (LISA) GameSchedule API and generates an ICS calendar file for easy import into calendar applications.

## Disclaimer

**This is an unofficial, community-created tool** that scrapes data from the LISA GameSchedule website. It is:
- NOT affiliated with or endorsed by the Lower Island Soccer Association
- NOT officially supported - it's a personal hack that may break if the API changes
- Provided as-is with no guarantees - YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)
- For personal use only

If the schedule stops updating or shows incorrect data, check the official LISA GameSchedule website.

## Features

- üóìÔ∏è Fetches game schedules from the LISA GameSchedule API
- üìÖ Generates standard ICS format compatible with all major calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc.)
- üîÑ Automated updates via GitHub Actions (runs every 20 minutes)
- üìç Includes game locations (field names) and team information
- ‚è∞ Handles TBD game times appropriately
- üéØ Filters for specific team schedules (currently configured for Lakehill U16 Division 2 Tier 3)

## Current Configuration

The script is currently configured for:
- **Team**: Lakehill SA (Team ID: 841)
- **Division**: U16 Boys Division 2 (Tier 3) (Division ID: 161)
- **Competition**: 12
- **Season**: 2025-2026 (Sept 2025 - Aug 2026)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmottishaw/soccer-schedule-ics.git
cd soccer-schedule-ics
```

2. Create a virtual environment (required for WSL):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Manual Generation

Run the script to generate the ICS file:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

This will create `soccer_schedule.ics` in the current directory.

### Automated Generation (GitHub Actions)

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Runs every 20 minutes
- Generates an updated ICS file
- Commits it to the `gh-pages` branch
- Makes it available via GitHub Pages

To enable this:
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Enable GitHub Actions in your repository settings
3. Enable GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch
4. The ICS file will be available at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/soccer-schedule-ics/soccer_schedule.ics`

### Live Calendar Subscription

Once hosted on GitHub Pages, you can subscribe to the live schedule that auto-updates:

**Google Calendar:**
1. Open Google Calendar
2. Click the + next to "Other calendars"
3. Select "From URL"
4. Enter: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/soccer-schedule-ics/soccer_schedule.ics`
5. Click "Add calendar"

**Apple Calendar:**
1. Open Calendar app
2. File ‚Üí New Calendar Subscription
3. Enter the URL above
4. Set auto-refresh frequency (recommended: every hour)

**Outlook/Other:**
- Most calendar apps support subscribing to ICS URLs
- Look for "Subscribe to calendar" or "Add from URL" option
- The calendar will automatically sync with updates every 20 minutes via GitHub Actions

## Configuration

To update for a different team or season, modify these values in `main.py`:

### API Parameters (lines 32-63)
- `strCompetition`: Competition ID (currently "12")
- `DIVISION VALUE`: Division ID (line 45, currently 161)
- `TEAM VALUE`: Team ID (line 49, currently 841)

### Calendar Metadata (lines 86-87)
- Calendar name and description

### Season Year Logic (line 101)
- Update the month threshold for determining the year
- Current: Sept-Dec = 2025, Jan-Aug = 2026

## Exhibition Games

You can add exhibition/friendly games not in the regular schedule by updating `exhibition.csv`:
```csv
Date,Time,Home Team,Guest Team,Field
2024-11-02,2:30 PM,Peninsula U15T3,Lakehill U14 Tier 3,Blue Heron Turf
```

## Dependencies

- `requests`: HTTP API calls
- `beautifulsoup4`: HTML parsing
- `icalendar`: ICS file generation
- `pytz`: Timezone handling

```

## Troubleshooting

### No games showing up
- Verify the division and team IDs are correct
- Check that the date range in `strWeekMin` and `strWeekMax` covers the current season
- Ensure the competition ID is correct

### Times showing as TBD
- This is normal for games without scheduled times yet
- The script will only create calendar events for TBD games within the next 6 days

### GitHub Actions failing
- Check that all required secrets are set (if any)
- Ensure the gh-pages branch exists
- Verify GitHub Actions and Pages are enabled

## Finding Team/Division IDs

To find the correct Competition, Division, and Team IDs for your team:

### Method 1: Browser Developer Tools
1. Visit https://lisa.gameschedule.ca
2. Navigate to your team's schedule page
3. Open browser developer tools (F12)
4. Go to the Network tab
5. Look for requests to `LOAD_SchedulePublic` or `LOAD_FilterValues`
6. Check the request payload for:
   - `strCompetition`: The competition ID (e.g., "12" for U16)
   - `DIVISION VALUE`: The division ID (e.g., 161 for U16 Boys Div 2 Tier 3)
   - `TEAM VALUE`: Your specific team ID (e.g., 841 for Lakehill SA)

### Method 2: Using the API Explorer (included)
1. Look at the `find_lakehill_team.py` script as an example
2. Modify it to search for your team name
3. Run it to discover the IDs:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python find_lakehill_team.py
```

### Common Competition IDs
- Different age groups typically have different competition IDs
- You may need to try multiple competition IDs to find your team
- The competition ID changes based on the league/age group
